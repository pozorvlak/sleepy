Hello, and welcome to sleepy. If you want to use this program, you're probably
my girlfriend, for whom it was written :-)

Indented lines should be typed at the command prompt (without the indentation).


INSTALLATION

First ensure that mplayer is installed:

On Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install mplayer

On Fedora:
    sudo yum install mplayer

See http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html#binaries for mplayer
installation instructions for other systems.

Ensure that sleepy is executable (this step /should/ be unnecessary...)
    chmod a+x sleepy

Next, copy sleepy somewhere that your system can find it:
    sudo cp sleepy /usr/local/bin

Anywhere in your PATH will do (type "echo $PATH" to see the full list), it
doesn't have to be /usr/local/bin.

That's it!
